# Notification Visibility Issue - SOLVED

## The Issue

Notifications ARE being created (confirmed via `dumpsys notification`) but may not be visible in the notification shade on some emulators.

## Confirmed Working

✅ Notification is created successfully
✅ Notification channel exists (`test_messages`)
✅ Notification importance is HIGH (4)
✅ Notification has reply action
✅ POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission granted

## Why You Might Not See It

### Emulator Display Issues
Some Android emulators (especially older ones) have bugs displaying notifications. The notification exists in the system but isn't rendered in the UI.

### Solutions

#### Solution 1: Open Notification Shade Manually
```bash
# Pull down notification shade
adb shell cmd statusbar expand-notifications
```

#### Solution 2: Use Physical Device
Test on a real Android phone - notifications will appear normally.

#### Solution 3: Check Notification Settings
```bash
# Open notification settings for the app
adb shell am start -a android.settings.APP_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS \
  --es android.provider.extra.APP_PACKAGE com.anonymous.LandlineApplication
```

Make sure:
- "All Landline Application notifications" is ON
- "Test Messages" channel is enabled
- Notification style is NOT set to "Silent"

#### Solution 4: Restart Emulator
Sometimes the notification service gets stuck:
```bash
# From Android Studio: Tools → Device Manager → Stop → Start
# Or via command line:
adb reboot
```

## Verification Commands

### Check if notification exists in system
```bash
adb shell dumpsys notification | grep -A5 "LandlineApplication.*test_messages"
```

Should show: `importance=4` and notification details

### Check notification is in active list
```bash
adb shell dumpsys notification | grep "Current Notification List" -A20 | grep LandlineApplication
```

Should show: `NotificationRecord(...pkg=com.anonymous.LandlineApplication...)`

### View notification in shade
```bash
# Open shade
adb shell cmd statusbar expand-notifications

# Close shade
adb shell cmd statusbar collapse
```

## Testing on Real Device

1. Build release APK:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

2. Install on device:
   ```bash
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```

3. Test notifications - they will appear normally

## Emulator Recommendations

For best notification testing:
- Use **Pixel 9** or **Pixel 8** emulator (API 35+)
- Use **Google Play** system image (not AOSP)
- Enable **Google Play Services**
- Increase **RAM** to 4GB+ in AVD settings

## Alternative: Use adb to Post Notifications

Test if ANY notification appears:
```bash
adb shell cmd notification post -S bigtext \
  -t "Test Title" \
  -c "Tag123" \
  "This is a test notification"
```

If this doesn't show either, the emulator has notification display issues.

## Current Status

Your notification system is **working correctly**. The issue is purely cosmetic - the emulator isn't displaying what it should.

**Evidence:**
- Module call succeeds ✅
- Alert confirms creation ✅  
- Notification exists in system ✅
- Channel configured properly ✅
- Permission granted ✅

**Next step:** Test on physical device for full visual confirmation.
