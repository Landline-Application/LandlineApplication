# Creating a Native Module

> We will be primarily focusing on Android for this guide, but can transfer over to iOS as needed.

This document will provide a step-by-step guide on how to create a native module for the application.

You can start by referring to the official Expo tutorial on [Creating a Native Module](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/native-module-tutorial/).

For this project, we will be creating the modules locally to the project.

Use this reference document for creating a local native module [Local Native Modules](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/get-started/#add-a-new-module-to-an-existing-application).
